# Project 2: Mike Kehoe's Portfolio

## Page Structure

This webpage uses HTML and CSS, incorporating some elements of the advanced CSS and flexbox information received during Module 2. The page has a standard nav bar, with each tab linked to its respective section on the home page ("About Me" is linked to the biography, "Projects" leads the user to the projects section, etc.).

While the "Projects" section currently displays placeholder images and does not contain actual links to completed projects, this is on the agenda for the portfolio's near-future developments.


## Project Reqirements

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
