# Project 2: Mike Kehoe's Portfolio

## Description

This webpage uses HTML and CSS, incorporating some elements of the advanced CSS and flexbox information received during Module 2. The page has a standard nav bar, with each tab linked to its respective section on the home page ("About Me" is linked to the biography, "Projects" leads the user to the projects section, etc.).

While the "Projects" section currently displays placeholder images and does not contain actual links to completed projects, this is on the agenda for the portfolio's near-future developments. The navigation bar and project labels also need continued work to display correctly, which will happen as the portfolio continues to be updated.
